# Methods

```
def foo(a,b):
  a + b
```
A method is defined with the `def` keyword, followed by an identifier and params. The colon indicates, that following lines are indented.

# Method call

`foo(a,b)` with params

`foo` without params. Parentheses are optional here.


# Basic type checking

When you do addition or subtraction, types are checked:

`3 - 4 # => ok`

`3 + 5 # => ok`

`3 + true # => false`
